        <button class="primary-btn">&lt  &gt</button>
        <code>&nbsp;</code>       

        <p style="text-indent: 100px;
        margin: 0px;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;  This usually gives us the 1px space.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0px;">here we are using the &nbps; which atcually gives us <br> the spacing in between the text or anywhere. </p>
